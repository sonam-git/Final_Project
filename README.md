# Overview

## The Challenge:
The challenge for our team was to develop a comprehensive social media application that offers a user-friendly interface and extensive functionality. The application needed to enable users to create, edit, and manage their posts while also providing the ability to discover the friend and post, where they can share their post, and comment to the other user's post. Our application ensures a seamless user experience, offering secure, responsive, and accessible features across various devices and screen sizes.

Our objectives for this challenge were as follows:

* Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
* Enable users to create, add, delete, and edit Posts
* Allow users to discover their friends, posts, other friends.
* Provide features for users to add comment to their friends post, and add the specific friend to their friendlist. 
* Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
